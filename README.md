## Introduction

Group Project: Create a Web Application

This is a prototype for an art museum or gallery wishing to provide its members and visitors with a way to navigate the pieces of art work on display. Ideally, the art would be populated using a well-maintained JSON formatted data so that it is always current. Visitors would be able to click on their favorites and it would generate a walking map to help the visitor get the most out of their gallery visit.

## Project Notes[![](./docs/img/pin.svg)](#project-notes)
<u>Goals</u>
* Our project used the mySQL starter files. 



<u>Challenges</u>
* Working with group members in other geographical locations and time zones always presents a challenge but our group worked through this by using Discord.
* Trying to ensure all group members had the same amount of Git commits was a challenge. This is because some commits had many complex changes (thus fewer commits) versus a large number of commits with just a few changes (such as typo correction).
